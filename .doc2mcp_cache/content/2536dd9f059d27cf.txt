Claude is a family of state-of-the-art large language models developed by Anthropic. This guide introduces our models and compares their performance.

Choosing a model
----------------

If you're unsure which model to use, we recommend starting with **Claude Sonnet 4.5**. It offers the best balance of intelligence, speed, and cost for most use cases, with exceptional performance in coding and agentic tasks.

All current Claude models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, and vision. Models are available via the Anthropic API, AWS Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI.

Once you've picked a model, [learn how to make your first API call](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/get-started).

### Latest models comparison

| Feature | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Claude Opus 4.5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | Our smart model for complex agents and coding | Our fastest model with near-frontier intelligence | Premium model combining maximum intelligence with practical performance |
| **Claude API ID** | claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 | claude-opus-4-5-20251101 |
| **Claude API alias**1 | claude-sonnet-4-5 | claude-haiku-4-5 | claude-opus-4-5 |

| **Pricing**2 | $3 / input MTok $15 / output MTok | $1 / input MTok $5 / output MTok | $5 / input MTok $25 / output MTok |
| **[Extended thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **[Priority Tier](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/service-tiers)** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Comparative latency** | Fast | Fastest | Moderate |
| **Context window** | 200K tokens / 1M tokens (beta)3 | 200K tokens | 200K tokens |
| **Max output** | 64K tokens | 64K tokens | 64K tokens |
| **Reliable knowledge cutoff** | Jan 2025 4 | Feb 2025 | May 2025 4 |
| **Training data cutoff** | Jul 2025 | Jul 2025 | Aug 2025 |

_1 - Aliases automatically point to the most recent model snapshot. When we release new model snapshots, we migrate aliases to point to the newest version of a model, typically within a week of the new release. While aliases are useful for experimentation, we recommend using specific model versions (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) in production applications to ensure consistent behavior._

_2 - See our [pricing page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) for complete pricing information including batch API discounts, prompt caching rates, extended thinking costs, and vision processing fees._

_3 - Claude Sonnet 4.5 supports a [1M token context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) when using the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header. [Long context pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing) applies to requests exceeding 200K tokens._

_4 - **Reliable knowledge cutoff** indicates the date through which a model's knowledge is most extensive and reliable. **Training data cutoff** is the broader date range of training data used. For example, Claude Sonnet 4.5 was trained on publicly available information through July 2025, but its knowledge is most extensive and reliable through January 2025. For more information, see [Anthropic's Transparency Hub](https://www.anthropic.com/transparency)._

Models with the same snapshot date (e.g., 20240620) are identical across all platforms and do not change. The snapshot date in the model name ensures consistency and allows developers to rely on stable performance across different environments.

Starting with **Claude Sonnet 4.5 and all future models**, AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI offer two endpoint types: **global endpoints** (dynamic routing for maximum availability) and **regional endpoints** (guaranteed data routing through specific geographic regions). For more information, see the [third-party platform pricing section](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#third-party-platform-pricing).

### Legacy models

Prompt and output performance
-----------------------------

Claude 4 models excel in:

*   **Performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See the [Claude 4 blog post](http://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) for more information.

  
*   **Engaging responses**: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.

  

    *   If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to our [prompt engineering guides](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) for details.
    *   For specific Claude 4 prompting best practices, see our [Claude 4 best practices guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices).

*   **Output quality**: When migrating from previous model generations to Claude 4, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.

  

Migrating to Claude 4.5
-----------------------

If you're currently using Claude 3 models, we recommend migrating to Claude 4.5 to take advantage of improved intelligence and enhanced capabilities. For detailed migration instructions, see [Migrating to Claude 4.5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/migrating-to-claude-4).
